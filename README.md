## Key Features:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pivot Tables: Leveraging Pivot Tables, I've conducted in-depth exploration of the dataset, effortlessly summarizing and visualizing key trends and patterns.

Data Manipulation and Analysis: Utilizing various Excel functions such as SWITCH(), IF(), IFS(), CONCAT(), SUMIF(), and SUMIFS(), I've created calculated columns, segmented customers, and derived valuable insights.

Forecasting and Scenario Analysis: Through the application of forecasting techniques including Simple Moving Average (SMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and trendlines, I've projected future sales trends. 

Additionally, I've utilized Goal Seek, Scenario Manager, and Data Tables to conduct scenario analysis, enabling informed decision-making.

## Approach:

Data Organization: I've kept the raw data in a separate worksheet for easy reference, allowing others to explore and work with the data at their own pace.
Analysis Segmentation: Each analysis is conducted in separate worksheets to maintain clarity and organization, enabling easy review and comparison of different parts.

Segmentation and Analysis: By utilizing grouping features, slicers, and logical functions, I segmented the data to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and upsell opportunities.
Forecasting and Scenario Analysis: Leveraging various forecasting techniques and scenario analysis tools, I projected future sales trends and evaluated different business scenarios to optimize decision-making processes.

## Insights and Findings:

Customer Segmentation: Analysis of customer segments revealed trends such as slower growth in enterprise sales compared to premium and business sales.
Upsell Opportunities: By calculating upsell revenue per non-paying user and analyzing sales trends, I identified opportunities to increase upsell revenue.
Forecasting Accuracy: Utilizing various forecasting techniques, I determined that exponential forecasting provided the best fit for the data, enabling more accurate predictions of future sales trends.
